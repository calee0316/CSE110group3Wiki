# Welcome to Ruihan Zhuang's Page!
Hi! I'm a third-year Math-cs major at UCSD. I was born in China and stayed there until I left for college. I'm in China right now because of the pandemic.<br/>
I'm undoubtedly fluent in Chinese but not so much in English. I'm working on that.
# My CS Experiences
Are mainly from the courses I've taken in UCSD:
* CSE 8A
* CSE 8B
* CSE 12
* CSE 30
* CSE 100
# What I Like
I like animals and keeping pets. I had a tortoise, a hamster, lots of fish, a ball python, and two other snakes. I currently have a dog named Snoopy. He's my best friend.
