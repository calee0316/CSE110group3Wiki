# About Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique made by Francesco Cirillo in 1980s. It incorporates the concept of working for shorter intervals (25 minutes as a default) and taking quick breaks (5 minutes) in between work intervals in order to increase productivity and focus overall. 

In our Pomodoro Timer, we have a default work period of 25 minutes and a default rest period of 5 minutes. You cannot pause or play the timer once you have started. This is because a pause feature would be counter-intuitive as the Pomodoro Technique is made so that you have 25 minutes of intense focus with no distractions or pausing. If you feel like you are done with work for the day, then you may click the "Stop" button and the timer will stop completely and the number of Pomos completed will reset to 0. 

After 4 consecutive Pomos, a longer break is given, usually of 15-30 minutes. This longer break is given only when 4 consecutive work-rest cycles have been completed. Stopping the timer will not preserve the number of cycles completed, it will reset the number back to 0.

In order to keep the concept and theme of focus, no sounds or changes in the page will happen during the 25 minutes of work. Only the timer will countdown. Once the 25 minutes are up, a sound will be played as a reminder to stop working and take a break, alongside a visual cue. The same will be done when the break is completed.
